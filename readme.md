# DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING INDE 577

## WHAT IS THIS REPOSITORY?: AN INTRODUCTION
This repository is authored by Patricio Zorrilla Amaya, a Mexican graduate student of the Master of Industrial Engineering program at Rice University. 

This folder contains all the coding projects for the course INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning instructed by Dr. Randy Davila during the Spring 2024 Semester. The main topics of the course are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The code found in this repository is based off of classroom examples. 

Each of the topics will include the mathematical backing of the techniques to extract and interpret a data set to make meaningful decisions. Each topic will have its associated subdirectory containing a Python (ver 3) jupyter notebook, a README file, associated images if there are any, and dataset files.
