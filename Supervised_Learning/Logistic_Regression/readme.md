# Logistic Regression in Machine Learning

![Logistic regression](sigmoid.png)

This project involves using logistic regression to predict heart disease from various clinical parameters. It demonstrates the application of logistic regression, a statistical machine learning method, to a real-world medical dataset. The objective is to identify individuals at higher risk of heart disease based on their medical profiles.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains clinical measures from individuals and an indicator of whether they were diagnosed with heart disease within a ten-year period. Key variables include age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and glucose levels, among others. The Dataset was obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression/data)
