# Linear Regression 

![Linear Regression Image](lr.png)


This repository contains the implementation of both single and multiple linear regression models to predict student performance based on various predictors. Here, we explain the data, the models, and how to run the scripts.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains a [Jupyter Notebook](./Linear_Regression.ipynb) with the math explanation and step-by-step training of both the single and multiple linear regression models.

There are two datasets:
* Salary_Data.csv with two columns: YearsExperience and Salary. This is used to model the single linear regression model. This dataset was obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vikramjeetsinghs/salary-prediction-on-the-basis-of-experience)
* Student_Performance.csv with 6 columns: Hours Studied,PreviousScores,ExtracurricularActivities,SleepHours,SampleQuestionPapersPracticed,PerformanceIndex. This is used to model the multiple linear regression model. This dataset was obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression)
