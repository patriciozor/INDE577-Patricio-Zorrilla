This project utilizes various ensemble machine learning methods to predict wine quality from physicochemical properties using the Wine Quality dataset. The techniques applied, such as Bagging, Random Forests, and Hard Voting Classifiers, are thoroughly explained and demonstrated in the [jupyter notebook](Ensemble_Methods.ipynb) within this subrepository.


## Dataset
The dataset comprises physicochemical test results from several thousand wines, with features like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, and others. The target variable is the quality rating of the wine, scaled from 3 to 8.

This dataset is particularly chosen for its applicative value in educational settings and was downloaded from within the jupyter notebook from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv 

## Repository Structure
This subrepository includes:
- A [jupyter notebook](Ensemble_Methods.ipynb) that details the application and analysis of various ensemble methods.
- A PNG image visualizing the concept of ensemble methods.
- This README file.
