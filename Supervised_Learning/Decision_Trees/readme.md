This project employs the Decision Tree algorithm to predict employee attrition based on an HR analytics dataset. The process of constructing the Decision Tree, including the handling and interpretation of the data, is detailed in the [jupyter notebook](Decision_Trees_HR_Attrition.ipynb) inside this subrepository.

In this workbook, we examine various aspects of Decision Tree implementation. As this is an educational resource, any challenges encountered during the implementation are documented within the notebook, providing valuable learning opportunities.

## Dataset
The dataset includes records for several hundred employees, with features such as age, monthly income, job role, marital status, and others. The target variable is employee attrition, indicating whether an employee has left the company.

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/code/senbagaraman/hr-analysis-imbalanced-dataset)

## Repository Structure
This subrepository contains:
* A [jupyter notebook](Decision_Trees_HR_Attrition.ipynb) that outlines the construction and application of the Decision Tree model.
* A PNG image that visualizes the Decision Tree model.
* This README file.
* The dataset file named HR_Analytics.csv
